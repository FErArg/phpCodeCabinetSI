phpCodeCabinetSI - README

Based in the work of Brad Fears by SerInformaticos

Purpose: Collect code snippets from any and all languages
         for quick reference.

Core functionality goals of this project:

1. Quickly searchable by snippet name, description, language,
   category, or author.

2. Must have categories / subcategories to organize snippets.

3. Must be able to store code snippets from any language,
   with highlighting provided by external library (Beautifier).

4. Must be accessible online or offline, so it must have
   importing / exporting capabilities.

5. Should plug into any website, with user authentication and
   ownership capabilities.

6. Must be platform independent, and browser independent.

7. Must utilize database abstraction layers.

   NOTE: Abstraction layers are included for MySQL and
         PostgreSQL.

8. Must be theme-able.


LOGIC BEHIND CATEGORY ADMINISTRATION:

1. Categories will be created in hierarchical fashion, with
   each category [db] record reflecting a "parent id", which
   will track the hierarchical structure.  Categories with
   parent ids of zero will be top level categories.

2. Each category will have a designated "owner", being the user
   that created the category, regardless of where it stands in
   the hierarchical structure.

3. Each category can only be modified and/or deleted by the
   owner, and deletions can only occur if there are no code
   snippets or other categories listed as children of that
   category.  This means:

   a. All code snippets or categories under a specific category
      must be re-classified before removing the category.

   b. Modifications to a category can occur in 3 ways:

      - If all code snippets or subcategories are
        owned by the parent category's owner.
      - By an administrator, suggested by the owner
        of the category.
      - With permission granted from each owner of
        each code snippet or category underneath
	the category in question. (The requirements
	for this one are not likely to be met, as
	users disappear over time, leaving their
	code snippets unmaintained).

4. Users may suggest changes to unowned categories, but those
   changes can only be imposed by the owner, providing the
   category does not meet any of the restrictions from rule 3.
   Changes that require admin privileges can ONLY be
   requested by the owner of a category.  Allowing non-owners
   to suggest changes directly to admins makes administration
   difficult, and poses a potential security risk.

5. Administrators have duties equivalent to moderators of a
   forum, weeding out ridiculous entries or censoring content
   per the guidelines of the hosting site.

6. Ownership of categories can be transferred from one user
   to another by administrators should they find it necessary
   to do so.  However, ownership of subcategories or code
   snippets underneath the transferred category will not
   change ownership.


Example Diagram of Categories and Rules:


       Languages (Owned by Brad)
       ---------
          |
  --------------------------------------
  |                 |                  |
 PHP (by Bob)     Perl (by Joe)     Python (By Brad)
 ---              ----              ------
                                       |
              ---------------------------------------
	      |                   |                 |
	Networking (by Lucy)     FTP (by Joe)     HTTPS (by Brad)
        ----------               ---              -----

==> Lucy, Joe, and Brad were able to create categories under
    Brad's "Python" category, but cannot delete or modify
    the Python category.

==> Lucy can delete her "Networking" category as long as
    there are no other categories or code snippets underneath it.

==> If Lucy owns all code snippets and categories underneath
    her "Networking" category, they all must be re-classified
    or removed before deleting the "Networking" category.

==> Brad can no longer delete his "Python" category, unless
    by chance everything underneath it were removed or
    re-classified by their appropriate owners (not likely).

==> If Lucy wants the "Python" category to be modified, she
    will have to suggest the change to Brad, who could then
    make a decision based on Lucy's request and suggest
    the change be made by an administrator.

==> Lucy wants "Python" changed because it's not quite
    appropriate, yet there are others who are already using
    the category for their code.  Lucy should just create
    another category under "Languages" that might be more
    appropriate for what she is doing.
