phpCodeCabinet - INSTALL

Installation of phpCC is relatively simple:

1. Untar and copy the contents of the phpcc directory to
   the web directory of your choice.

   tar xzf phpcc-x.x-tar.gz -C /your/web/directory


2. If necessary, set up a database for phpCC using the
   following set of commands (assuming you have rights):

   ---------- MySQL ----------
   
   /location/of/mysql/bin/mysql -uroot -p

   mysql> create database <nameofyourdatabase>;

   mysql> GRANT CREATE,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,SELECT,ALTER \
       -> ON <nameofyourdatabase>.* TO <username>@localhost \
       -> IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

   mysql> quit;

   
   ---------- PostgreSQL ----------
  
   $ su - postgres
   $ createdb <nameofyourdatabase>
   $ createuser -D -A -P 
     Enter name of user to add: <username>
     Enter password for user "<username>":
     Enter it again:
   $ exit

  

3. Modify the config.php file with the appropriate settings.
   The configuration options in config.php are explained in
   the comments.  Be sure to review each of the values, including
   the datbase username/password and HFile directory (used for
   Beautifier).
   

4. Next, access phpCC through the web interface by pointing
   your browser at the following url:
   
   http://<yourdomain.com>/<phpCC-directory>/setup.php

   Choose the 'Check Configuration' option to verify the validity
   of your config.php settings, then choose the appropriate
   option for a fresh install or an upgrade.

   IMPORTANT: When you are finished with the setup.php file, be
              sure to delete it.  Once the database tables are
	      fixed for the appropriate version, it is no longer
	      required, so it is much safer to simply remove it
	      from the phpCC directory.


5. Log into phpCC using 'admin' for the username and 'phpcc' for
   the password.  Be sure to change the password.

6. You can begin creating categories as long as you are logged in
   as a user (admin optional).  A fresh install will have no
   top-level categories, so plan accordingly before starting your
   category structure.

   NOTE: For category examples, see the online demo at
         http://phpcc.mtsdev.com/demo/.
