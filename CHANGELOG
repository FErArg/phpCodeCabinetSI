--------------------------------------------
CHANGELOG for phpCodeCabinet v0.5 (since 0.4)
--------------------------------------------

1. Fixed bug in snippet.php and input.php that
   stripped slashes from snippet if 'magic_quotes_gpc'
   was enabled in the php.ini.
   
2. Added another link for "ENTER CODE" in the
   category bar below the snippet listings.
   (Just to make it easier to find.)
   
3. Added option in config.php to specify allowable
   html tags for form fields other than the actual
   snippet (which allows all html tags by default).
   
4. Modified search.php to include author name/email
   and language when searching.  Now also presents
   snippet category with search results.
   
5. Fixed bug in category deletion that leaves
   subcategories and snippets orphaned.  Category
   deletion is now recursive in deleting
   subcategories and snippets, provided user is
   either an admin or owns all subordinate items.

6. Fixed http script injection vulnerability
   within several files.  Thanks to Yao-Wen (Wayne)
   Huang for pointing them out.

7. Tabs are now preserved within code snippets.

8. Added functionality for importing / exporting
   categories and snippets. Currently exports in
   CSV format.

--------------------------------------------
CHANGELOG for phpCodeCabinet v0.4 (since 0.3)
--------------------------------------------

1. Added several database indexes for optimized
   queries. (Thanks to Cameron Brunner)

2. Admins now have rights to modify or delete
   any snippet, regardless of ownership.
   
3. Modified search to include actual code
   snippets (work still needs to be done
   for optimization of the search).

4. Added option to load printable version of
   each snippet in new browser window.
   
5. Added check for 'magic_quotes_gpc' variable
   upon inserting or updating code snippets.
   
6. Highlight mode and category selection lists
   are now ordered alphabetically.
   
7. Linebreaks will now be preserved in
   description and comment fields for snippets.
   
8. Modified snippet and subcategory summary
   info in browse.php to improve readability.
   
9. User's full name and email are now automatically
   inserted in code input form providing the user
   has logged in and filled out the full name and
   email information for their account.

CHANGELOG for phpCodeCabinet v0.3 (since 0.2)
--------------------------------------------

1. Fixed bug in setup that incorrectly attempted
   to rename tables when upgrading.

2. Modified database abstraction layer for MySQL
   to return mysql errors as strings rather than
   echo'ing to the screen.

3. Created additional checks in setup.php for
   installation/upgrade of database tables, as
   well as an option for checking the validity
   of configuration variables defined in the
   config.php file.

4. Fixed syntax error in Beautifier package for
   html syntax highlighting.  Thanks to Lonnie
   Webb for the fix.

5. Fixed problem in creating first category
   after a fresh installation (logged in as
   admin account).  Option for creating a top-
   level category while browsing was missing,
   but categories could be created from admin
   menus.  Admin should now be able to create
   first category from either place.
   
6. Fixed minor html errors for backward
   compatibility, including the removal of
   enctype form element.

7. Added code to strip html tags from form fields
   upon inserting or editing a snippet.  This is
   designed to prevent someone from creating
   links or other annoying html elements in the
   fields.

8. Added config options to disallow indexing by
   search engines using <META> tag.

9. Added option to change default site <title>
   for standalone installations.

10. Fixed menu bar to display 'USER INFO' for
    admin users as well as other authenticated
    users.

11. Added abstraction layer and modified SQL
    syntax for PostgreSQL comptability.
    Special thanks to Doug Damon for all the
    code to make this work.

CHANGELOG for phpCodeCabinet v0.2 (since 0.1)
--------------------------------------------

1. Fixed bug in input.php that prevented use
   of "Unlisted Language" option.  There now
   exists an option for "Unlisted", which is
   tied to a syntax file in the Beautifier
   package.

2. Modified database table structure to use
   prefixes for table names, for those users
   with access to only one database.  Table
   prefix can be configured as a global
   variable.

3. Installation process now uses web interface
   for database configurations.
